================******/

What I Learned:

- Bash and CSV file automated user creation.
- Parsing of input using `IFS` and `read`.
- bash conditional statements, loops, handling strings.
- Files and folder permission management.
- backup and archiving with `tar`.
- use of symbolic links with `ln -s`.

What Was Easy:

- Writing simple bash syntax coding.
- Using commands like `useradd`, `mkdir`, `groupadd`, `chmod`, `ln`.

What Was Challenging:

- Group creation with more than one group in one field.
- Handling folder ownership and permissions dynamically.
- Symbolic links creation in a correct manner with correct paths.
- User creation test without affecting system users.
- Ensuring error handling and prompt messages in backup script.

How I Overcame the Challenges:

- Attempted scripts in a Docker container for security.
- Used `read -r` and `IFS` with care so that it doesn't disrupt CSV parsing.
- Debugged by adding additional `echo` statements for the variables.
- Asked peers and ChatGPT for clarification.
- Tested script operation by manually verifying creation of user, group, and folder.

Final Thoughts:

This assignment improved my skill in Linux, file systems, and bash scripting. I can now automate repetitive jobs with simple and effective scripts.
