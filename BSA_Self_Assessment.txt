BSA Self Assessment - Bash Scripting Automation Project

- I successfully created a user management script that reads a CSV file.
- The script extracts usernames, formats passwords, and adds users to the correct groups.
- Shared folders are created with correct permissions.
- Symbolic links to shared folders are placed in each user's home directory.
- I followed best practices in Git and Docker.
- README contains setup and usage instructions.
